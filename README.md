This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Thanks, Facebook.

I also used some creative stuff from articles on Tympanus, this one: [Creative Button Styles](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/06/13/creative-button-styles/) 
and also this one, [Inspiration for Navigation Indicators](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/09/02/inspiration-navigation-indicators/)
Thank you, Mary Lou from Tympanus.

Mockups for images are from here: [Canvas Bag Mockup](http://graphicburger.com/canvas-tote-bag-mockup/) and [T-shirt mockup](http://www.pixeden.com/psd-mock-up-templates/classic-psd-t-shirt-mockup-vol1).
